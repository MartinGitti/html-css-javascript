# html-css-javascript
## First project working with the three basic front end languages together. 

<p>
There are three tasks covered in this project.
All the tasks focus mainly on the functionality of a web page, rather than styling.
</p>

<p>
HTML is used to display content in the browser & to aid with a basic structure for the web page.
Css is used for styling & to assist with layout of page.
JavaScript is used add some logic to page which helps with functionality & to make the web page dynamic.
</p>

<p>
In order to view the tasks in the browser, I open them in a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. I have an extention for these text editors that allows me to open them in the browser, using a live server. This really also helps me to edit or debug the code if need be. To open the task with a live server, ensure that you are in the file with the .html extension.

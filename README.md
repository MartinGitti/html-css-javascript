# html-css-javascript
* First project working with the three basic front end languages together. HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

<p>
There are three tasks covered in this project.
All the tasks focus mainly on the functionality of a web page, adding logic to a Web Page rather than styling.
</p>

<p>
  HTML is used to display content in the browser & to gice basic basic structure to a Web Page,

</p>
<p>
  CSS is used for styling & to assist with layout of page,
  <span>:thinking: Think of clothing the human body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  JavaScript is used add some logic to page which helps with functionality & to make the web page dynamic.

</p>

<p>
  In order to view the tasks in the browser, I open them in a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. I have an extention for these text editors   that allows me to open them in the browser, using a live server. This really also helps me to edit or debug the code if need be. To open the task with a live         server, ensure that you are in the file with the .html extension.

### Use of code:
<p>Please feel free to use the code of the projects above.</p>
<p>I've made use of a text editor to put all of my code together and used Google Chrome as my default browser to view my Web Pages.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, I'd suggest using a Text Editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</p>

<span>Happy Coding :sunglasses:</span>
